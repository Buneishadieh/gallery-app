### Known Bugs

Given: An admin url<br>
When: User enters admin url in browser<br>
Then: Admin Login is displayed<br>

* User authentication occurs when Admin tries to Login<br>
Given:Admin page is accessed<br>
When: User tries to login<br>
Then: User details are authenticated to confirm if user is an admin<br>
